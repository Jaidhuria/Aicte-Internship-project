# Aicte-Internship-project
# Diabetes Prediction Project

This is a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a person has diabetes based on various health-related factors. The model is built using Python, with a focus on data exploration, preprocessing, and the application of machine learning algorithms for classification.
## Overview

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on a set of medical attributes such as age, BMI, insulin levels, and other health indicators. By using a dataset containing these features, a machine learning model is trained and evaluated.
## Dependencies

The following libraries are required to run the project:

- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical computations
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning models and evaluation

## Data

The dataset used for this project is publicly available and contains various features like age, BMI, insulin levels, etc., to predict whether a person has diabetes. The dataset can be found in the `data/` folder under `diabetes_data.csv`.

## Results

The script provides a comprehensive evaluation of the machine learning models' performance.
  Key metrics include:
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified instances
- **Precision**: Correct positive predictions divided by total positive predictions
- **Recall**: Correct positive predictions divided by total actual positives
